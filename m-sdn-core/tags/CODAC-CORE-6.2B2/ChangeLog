Changes for 1.0.12 (MARTe2 Integration):

- Clean-up header dependencies: sdn-api.h, sdn-topic.h.
- Create MARTe-ping and MARTe-echo programs.

Changes for 1.0.11 (MARTe2 Integration):

- Disable packet footer as the implementation is not robust.
- Fix constness of some attributes in sdn-api.h.

Changes for 1.0.10 (MARTe2 Integration):

- Use virtual destructors, where appropriate, to ensure the right destructor is invoked event
  manipulating instances through the base class.
- Bug 9397 - Unicast participants should be deployable on the same host (test purposes). Note
  that the implementation binds the socket to the named interface and, as such, only the latest
  bind will receive the message; this implies that the sdn::ucast::Subscriber is configured
  after the sdn::ucast::Publisher.

Changes for 1.0.9 (MARTe2 Integration):

- Added development-specific environment variables SDN_CORE_INCLUDE_DIR and
  SDN_CORE_LIBRARY_DIR.

- sdn::Topic API extended to fully support topic definition (use case being that of
  an external application configuration parser).
- The topic metadata could be instantiated  with sdn::Topic_InitializeMetadata using topic
  name of the form 'sdn://<address>:<port>/<name>', e.g. 'sdn://127.0.0.1:60000/MyTopic'.
- Similarly, explicit destination address can be specified with sdn::Topic_InitializeMetadata
  using the form '<address>:<port>', e.g. '127.0.0.1:60000'.

Changes for 1.0.8:

- Ported to cpp-common 1.1.7 to support changeable logging callback and usage of log-lib
  in case a program links to both sdn-core and log-lib.
- Bug 9354 - Recover ability to create sdn::Participant in absence of topic definition
	     XML file using explicit topic name and size.

Changes for 1.0.7:

- Removed sdn::mcast and sdn::ucast composite and asynchronous participants.
- sdn::base::Participant as common interface to sdn::mcast or sdn::ucast.
- sdn::core::Participants instantiate sdn::mcast or sdn::ucast based on address range.
- Bug 9249 - Introduce checks on attributes and payload limits.
- Bug 9290 - Rank mismatch between attribute list and extended qualifiers, units, etc.

Changes for 1.0.6:

- Increase maximum topic size to 64kB.
- Remove dependency to sdn-header and sdn-footer XML datatype definition file
  to allow for opeation on machines where SDN_TOPIC_PATH or CODAC_CONF is left
  undefined.
- sdn::core::Subscriber topic validity checks amended to allow for disabling topic version
  or UID tests at Subscriber level.
- sdn::core::Participants with callback support as part of message handling.
- sdn::Participant inherit from sdn::core::Participants and notify
  sdn::disc::Publisher to gratuitously emit join/announce/leave messages.
- Introduction of sdn-core.h and sdn-api.h public header files and PIMPL design
  pattern so as to avoid exposing internal structure through the public header files.
- Bug 7919 - Test validity of SDN_INTERFACE_NAME in sdn::core::Participant::SetInterface()
             and sdn::core::Participant::Configure().
- Bug 8722 - Added sdn_is_interface_valid() API to test validity of SDN_INTERFACE_NAME or
             and net_is_interface_valid(char*) for any interface defined by name.
- Bug 9225 - Topic mappings to ports below 1024 require superuser priviledges.

Changes for 1.0.5:

- sdn::disc::Participants introduced.

Changes for 1.0.4:

- sdn::core::Participants registered to object database to support dynamic discovery.
- sdn::Topic allows for providing explicit UID through XML topic definition file.
- sdn::Topic API extended to fully support topic definition (use case being that of
  an external application configuration parser).

Changes for 1.0.3:

- Redefine namespaces to sdn::base, sdn::mcast and sdn::core.
- Bug 8874 - SDN_TOPIC_PATH variable definition included in this unit.
- sdn::Topic API to declare attributes dynamically (proxi to base::AnyType API).

Changes for 1.0.2:

- mcast::Participant re-designed for explicit Open/Close virtual methods.
- mcast::Participant re-designed to support composite pattern.
- mcast::Participant re-designed to support asynchronous pattern.

Changes for 1.0.1:
